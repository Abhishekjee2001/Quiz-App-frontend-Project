Quiz Application 🎯

This is a simple and interactive quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The app displays multiple-choice questions, allows users to select answers, and shows the final score at the end. 
It helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, basic logic implementation, and responsive UI design using core web technologies.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
